# Technology Benchmark for a Workflow Automation Platform (Zapier-like)

## Global Context

The goal is to develop a **web application similar to IFTTT or Zapier**, where users can create, configure, and run automated workflows.  
Such a platform requires:

- A **scalable backend** capable of handling many concurrent requests.
- A **database** able to manage both structured and semi-structured data with strong scalability.
- A **frontend** that provides a rich, interactive workflow builder (drag-and-drop, event triggers, visual flows).
- A stack that balances **performance, scalability, developer productivity, and security**.

After evaluation, the following choices were made:

- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript

# 1. Backend Benchmark: FastAPI vs NestJS vs Go

## Comparison Table

| Criteria                 | FastAPI (Python)                                 | NestJS (Node.js/TS)                        | Go (Golang)                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**             | Python                                           | TypeScript / JavaScript                    | Go                                             |
| **Raw Performance**      | Average (Python interpreter, depends on uvicorn) | Good (Node.js + TypeScript, scalable)      | Excellent (compiled, close to C performance)   |
| **Ease of Development**  | Very high (clear syntax, little boilerplate)     | Medium to high (MVC structure, decorators) | Medium (simple syntax but lower level)         |
| **Ecosystem**            | Rich (AI, data science, web, SQLAlchemy ORM)     | Large (npm, frontend/backend, modern libs) | Decent (solid stdlib, but smaller ecosystem)   |
| **Learning Curve**       | Low for Python developers                        | Medium (TypeScript + Nest concepts)        | Medium (simple syntax but different paradigm)  |
| **Scalability**          | Limited by Python GIL, good for I/O APIs         | Good (microservices-oriented, websockets)  | Very good (native concurrency support)         |
| **Community**            | Large (especially data/AI oriented)              | Large (backed by the JS ecosystem)         | Large and active (DevOps/backend focus)        |
| **ORM / DB Integration** | SQLAlchemy, Tortoise, Prisma (less mature)       | TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose (very mature)    | GORM, sqlx (good but lower level)              |
| **Typical Use Case**     | Quick APIs, ML/AI integrations                   | Full web apps, Node-based microservices    | High-performance services, distributed systems |

## Decision

**NestJS** was chosen for the backend because:

## Conclusion

- **Flutter**

  - Strength: fast development, cross-platform, great UI/UX consistency, strong widget ecosystem.
  - Weakness: larger app size, heavy SDK, smaller Dart adoption compared to JS/Kotlin.

- **React Native**

  - Strength: large ecosystem, huge JS/TS developer base, faster ramp-up for web devs.
  - Weakness: relies on native bridges for performance-critical parts, UI consistency can vary.

- **Native (Kotlin)**
  - Strength: best performance and full access to Android APIs.
  - Weakness: single-platform only, slower development, more expensive to maintain for multi-platform.

---

## Security and Maintenance Risks

- **Flutter**:

  - Risk of large bundle size exposing unused packages → mitigate by tree-shaking and package audits.
  - Dependency ecosystem still maturing → mitigate by selecting well-maintained packages.

- **React Native**:

  - Risk of dependency vulnerabilities (npm) → mitigate with regular audits.
  - Native module fragmentation can lead to inconsistent behaviors → mitigate with stable libraries and version pinning.

- **Native (Kotlin)**:
  - No major cross-platform risks, but higher maintenance cost (requires a separate iOS team if targeting both platforms).
  - Risk of code duplication across platforms → mitigate with shared business logic (e.g., Kotlin Multiplatform if needed).

---

## Final Decision

**Flutter** was chosen for the mobile application because:

- Our mobile developer is already experienced with Flutter, reducing the risk of beginner mistakes.
- Flutter provides a **cross-platform solution** with consistent UI/UX across Android and iOS.
- It offers **fast development cycles** (hot reload, widget ecosystem) which aligns with the project’s need for rapid iteration.
- While app size is larger compared to native, this trade-off is acceptable given the productivity and consistency benefits.
