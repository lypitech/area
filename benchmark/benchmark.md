# Technology Benchmark for a Workflow Automation Platform (Zapier-like)

## Global Context

The goal is to develop a **web application similar to IFTTT or Zapier**, where users can create, configure, and run automated workflows.  
Such a platform requires:

- A **scalable backend** capable of handling many concurrent requests.
- A **database** able to manage both structured and semi-structured data with strong scalability.
- A **frontend** that provides a rich, interactive workflow builder (drag-and-drop, event triggers, visual flows).
- A stack that balances **performance, scalability, developer productivity, and security**.

After evaluation, the following choices were made:

- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript

# 1. Backend Benchmark: FastAPI vs NestJS vs Go

## Comparison Table

| Criteria                 | FastAPI (Python)                                 | NestJS (Node.js/TS)                        | Go (Golang)                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**             | Python                                           | TypeScript / JavaScript                    | Go                                             |
| **Raw Performance**      | Average (Python interpreter, depends on uvicorn) | Good (Node.js + TypeScript, scalable)      | Excellent (compiled, close to C performance)   |
| **Ease of Development**  | Very high (clear syntax, little boilerplate)     | Medium to high (MVC structure, decorators) | Medium (simple syntax but lower level)         |
| **Ecosystem**            | Rich (AI, data science, web, SQLAlchemy ORM)     | Large (npm, frontend/backend, modern libs) | Decent (solid stdlib, but smaller ecosystem)   |
| **Learning Curve**       | Low for Python developers                        | Medium (TypeScript + Nest concepts)        | Medium (simple syntax but different paradigm)  |
| **Scalability**          | Limited by Python GIL, good for I/O APIs         | Good (microservices-oriented, websockets)  | Very good (native concurrency support)         |
| **Community**            | Large (especially data/AI oriented)              | Large (backed by the JS ecosystem)         | Large and active (DevOps/backend focus)        |
| **ORM / DB Integration** | SQLAlchemy, Tortoise, Prisma (less mature)       | TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose (very mature)    | GORM, sqlx (good but lower level)              |
| **Typical Use Case**     | Quick APIs, ML/AI integrations                   | Full web apps, Node-based microservices    | High-performance services, distributed systems |

## Decision

**NestJS** was chosen for the backend because:

- Provides **structured and opinionated architecture**, crucial for complex workflow applications.
- Excellent **ecosystem** with npm and TypeScript, enabling fast integration of external services.
- Built-in support for **microservices and websockets**, aligned with event-driven workflow execution.
- Good balance between **performance and developer productivity** compared to FastAPI (simpler but less scalable) and Go (faster but more low-level).

## Security Risks and Mitigations

- **Validation misconfiguration** → Always enable global validation (ValidationPipe with whitelist, forbidNonWhitelisted).
- **CORS misconfigurations** → Restrict allowed origins in production.
- **Weak JWT/auth handling** → Use short-lived tokens, refresh strategies, secure secret storage.
- **NoSQL/SQL injection** → Always use parameterized queries and sanitize inputs.
- **Supply chain attacks** → Audit npm dependencies regularly and pin versions.
- **Rate limiting** → Use throttling to prevent DoS.

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Type**             | Relational (SQL)                               | NoSQL (document-oriented)                   | Relational (SQL, MySQL fork)            |
| **Raw Performance**  | Very good, especially for complex queries      | Excellent for massive read/write operations | Good, optimized for simple queries      |
| **Scalability**      | Vertical and horizontal (extensions available) | Excellent (sharding, native replication)    | Good but less advanced than MongoDB     |
| **Data Flexibility** | Strict schema, but supports JSON/JSONB         | Very flexible (schema-less documents)       | SQL schema, low flexibility             |
| **Transactions**     | Full ACID                                      | Limited multi-document transactions         | Full ACID                               |
| **Ecosystem**        | Rich (PostGIS, TimescaleDB, many extensions)   | Large (big data tools, BI, integrations)    | Large (MySQL compatibility, many tools) |
| **Learning Curve**   | Medium (advanced SQL features)                 | Medium (document paradigm differs from SQL) | Low if familiar with MySQL              |
| **Typical Use Case** | Critical apps, complex analytics, BI           | Big Data, IoT, logs, flexible apps          | Classic web apps, MySQL replacement     |

## Decision

**MongoDB** was chosen for the database because:

- Provides **schema flexibility**, essential to store workflow definitions, user configurations, and unstructured payloads.
- Built-in **sharding and replication**, ensuring horizontal scalability for millions of events.
- Strong ecosystem for **real-time data handling** (e.g., Change Streams for event-driven architectures).
- Easier to iterate quickly on new features compared to rigid relational schemas.

## Security Risks and Mitigations

- **Open instances without authentication** → Always enforce authentication and TLS.
- **NoSQL injection** → Sanitize inputs, restrict operators.
- **Overly permissive roles** → Use least-privilege roles per service.
- **Unencrypted data at rest** → Enable disk encryption and TLS for all connections.
- **Backup exposure** → Secure backup storage, rotate credentials.
